Debugging a React Website with React Developer Tools
This README provides instructions on how to debug a React application using the React Developer Tools browser extension or standalone application. Follow the steps below to identify and fix issues in a React application with state and props.

Overview
The debugging process involves:

Setting up a React application.
Inspecting the components' state and props.
Identifying and resolving any issues with the applicationâ€™s functionality.
Documenting the debugging process and verifying fixes.
Requirements
React Application: A sample React app with multiple components, state, and props.
React Developer Tools: Install the browser extension or standalone application.
Steps to Debug a React Application
1. Set Up the React Application
Clone or create a sample React application.
Ensure the application has multiple components with state management and props passing.
2. Install React Developer Tools
Browser Extension:
Install the React Developer Tools for your preferred browser (Chrome/Firefox).

Standalone Application:
Download the standalone version from the React Developer Tools repository if needed.

3. Inspect the Components Tree
Open your React application in the browser.
Open the React Developer Tools panel (accessible via browser dev tools or as a standalone window).
Navigate the components tree to inspect individual components.
4. Identify Issues
Use the following to identify problems:

State Inspection: Check if component states are set or updated correctly.
Props Inspection: Verify that props are passed as intended to child components.
Component Behavior: Look for unexpected behavior such as:
Missing or undefined props.
Incorrect state values.
Errors in component rendering logic.
5. Debug the Issues
Diagnose with Developer Tools:
Monitor component state changes in real-time.
Update props or state manually within the tools to test fixes.
Console Logs:
Use console.log() to track values in problematic areas of the code.
Edit Code:
Fix identified issues directly in the source code.
6. Document the Debugging Process
Note each issue encountered, including:
The component with the issue.
The problem identified (e.g., incorrect state updates).
The solution applied.
7. Verify Fixes
Reload the application and test it thoroughly to confirm the fixes resolve the issues.
Ensure there are no lingering bugs or unexpected behaviors.
Tips for Effective Debugging
Always start by reproducing the issue.
Break down the problem into smaller parts.
Test changes incrementally to avoid introducing new bugs.
Make use of the Profiler tab in React Developer Tools for performance debugging.
